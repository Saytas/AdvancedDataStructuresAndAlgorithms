Lists
- List is an abstract data type
- List is not a concrete data structure; it is an abstract data type
- There is an interface involved when it comes to abstract data types
- ArrayList
- LinkedList
- Vector
- AbstractList
- AbstractSequentialList
- If you want to implement the list interface, you want to create a custom implementation
- rather than starting with list itself and implementing that so extend abstract list

Abstract Data Type
- Does not dictate how the data is organized
- Dictates the operations you can perform
- Concrete data structure is usually a concrete class
- Abstract data type is usually an interface
- An abstract data type is more about behaviour and what operations you can do
