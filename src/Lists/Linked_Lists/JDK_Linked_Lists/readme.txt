- Because JDK LinkedList uses generics, you can use this LinkedList
  class with any type of object
- This implementation is no synchronized. So, if you want to use a LinkedList
  instance from multiple threads, we will have to synchronize the callas
  to any of the LinkedList methods
- In computer science, overhead is any combination of excess or indirect
  computation time, memory, bandwidth, or other resources that are required
  to perform a specific task. It is a special case of engineering overhead.
- There is another type of LinkedList called Circular LinkedList a variation
  on the Signly LinkedList. In this variation, the last Node in the list does
  not point to null. Instead, it loop back and it points to the Head of the list
  And one advantage to this, you can traverse the entire list starting at any Node
