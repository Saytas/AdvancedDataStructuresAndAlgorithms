Queues

- Queues are an abstract data type just like Stacks
  So they do not dictate how you store the data, but they do
  describe the way that you can access the data
- Just like Stacks, we use other data structures to implement
  them
- FIFO - first in, first out

3 Operations:
- Add - also called enqueue - add an item to the end of the queue
- Remove - also called dequeue - remove the item at the front of
  the queue
- Peek - get the item at the front of the queue, but do not
  remove it
- If you add an item the back pointer will change. If you remove
  an item the front item will change
